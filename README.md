# DevBootcamp April '16 Hackathon

### Prompt

Build a web service that addresses a civic concern in San Francisco, such as municipal transportation or the large homeless population.

### App Summary

Our application will let a user quickly select from a list of vital services, such as an overnight shelter, health care facility, or food bank. They will then be given directions to the nearest relevant facility from their current location.

### MVP Design
1. User opens application
2. User can choose what service they need from list of options
3. User inputs their current location
4. App displays route with directions to nearest location offering that service
